 ## ‚ú®<u> Viewing All Available Apis</u> 

Apis are Documentated using **Swagger**
 
 * to view them as your project is running 
    
    * go to your browser and type : http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html &crarr;

    * Open Your Api client Be it :

        * Postman
        * Insomnia 
    * Explore All available Apis.

    **Note**: Some Apis are Authenticated being able to access them is through a manager login ofcourse manager has to be 
    created.üòÅüòé
    and get a Token which is generated By _Jwts web tokens_. so that token it is what you will be using to access all Apis
    And voillaüéâ


___
## Running Application as **.jar**

While on Your IDE with the project opened 
Look for terminal and type this following 
command &rarr;
```bash
mvn clean install

```
That's It üòé simple then you have it as a _.jar_

## üòèView Integration Testing Coverage &rArr; 
For Unit Test and Integration Since we are using Json Web tokens to access some protected 
Apis you will need to have  passing  the token 
but we won't do that instead comment that 
code which are located in main class. 

**_Comment Lines  From 112 Line to 122_**

* then after test uncomment them
```Java
    @SpringBootApplication


public class EmployeesManagementApiApplication {
	@Autowired
	private EmailSenderService service;
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(EmployeesManagementApiApplication.class, args);
	}
    
//	@Bean
//	public FilterRegistrationBean<AuthFilter> filterRegistrationBean(){
//		FilterRegistrationBean<AuthFilter> registrationBean=new FilterRegistrationBean<>();
//		AuthFilter authFilter=new AuthFilter();
//		registrationBean.setFilter(authFilter);
//		registrationBean.addUrlPatterns("/api/employees/*");
//		registrationBean.addUrlPatterns("/api/admins");
//		return registrationBean;
//
//	}



}

## Ship The Application With Docker  üêã
